# 🏆 NVIDIA Hackathon Pitch - Accessibility Auditor

## 🎯 The Problem (30 seconds)
**15% of the world's population has disabilities** - that's over 1 billion people who struggle with inaccessible websites daily.

But it's not just about WCAG compliance - **poor visual design affects everyone**:

## 💬 Key Talking Points

### If Asked About Nemotron Choice:
"We chose Nemotron because it excels at multi-dimensional reasoning. It doesn't just flag issues - it understands the WHY behind accessibility and psychological principles, generating context-aware recommendations."

### If Asked About Psychology Aspect:
"WCAG tells you text needs 4.5:1 contrast. But psychology tells you WHY - how contrast affects cognitive load, reading speed, and user trust. We analyze both for complete UX improvement."

### If Asked About Development Process:
"We used AI-assisted development to rapidly prototype, focusing our time on the innovative dual-analysis approach and NVIDIA model integration. This is the future of development - human creativity augmented by AI."

## 🚀 Closing Statement

"Our Accessibility Auditor doesn't just make websites compliant - it makes them **human**. By combining WCAG standards with psychological principles through NVIDIA's Nemotron, we're not just checking boxes - we're creating inclusive, emotionally intelligent web experiences for everyone."
