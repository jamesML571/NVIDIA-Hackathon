# Category explanations - Why these changes matter
CATEGORY_WHY_EXPLANATIONS = {
    "[A11Y]": {
        "title": "Accessibility - Helping Real People",
        "why": "WCAG guidelines align with four fundamental human needs. Perceivable helps people with visual/hearing impairments see and hear your content. Operable helps people with physical disabilities navigate and interact. Understandable helps people with cognitive or learning differences process information. Robust ensures everyone can access content regardless of their assistive technology.",
        "benefits": [
            "PERCEIVABLE: Helps blind users hear content via screen readers, low-vision users see with zoom/contrast, deaf users access video captions",
            "OPERABLE: Enables people with motor disabilities to navigate via keyboard, those with seizure disorders avoid triggers, users with tremors click larger targets",
            "UNDERSTANDABLE: Supports people with dyslexia through clear fonts, those with ADHD via consistent navigation, autism spectrum users with predictable interactions",
            "ROBUST: Works for users on older devices, slow connections, or specialized assistive tech like switches or eye-tracking",
            "UNIVERSAL: Benefits everyone - captions help in noisy environments, keyboard nav helps power users, clear design helps when tired/stressed"
        ],
        "impact": "Each accessibility fix removes a real barrier for a real person. A mother with RSI using voice control. A veteran with low vision from injury. A student with dyslexia trying to learn. An elder staying connected with family. This isn't about compliance - it's about human connection."
    },
    "[Psych]": {
        "title": "Psychology & User Experience",
        "why": "Psychological design principles tap into how the human brain processes information. These changes reduce cognitive load, build trust, and guide users naturally through your content, resulting in higher conversion rates and user satisfaction.",
        "benefits": [
            "Increased conversion rates (up to 400% improvement documented)",
            "Reduced bounce rates (users stay longer when comfortable)",
            "Enhanced brand perception (professional appearance builds trust)",
            "Faster task completion (intuitive design reduces friction)",
            "Emotional engagement (positive feelings toward your brand)"
        ],
        "impact": "These improvements make users feel confident and in control, reducing anxiety and frustration. This translates directly to business metrics like sales, sign-ups, and user retention."
